# **🌍🚀 Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction Model using Machine Learning 💨📊**

## **📌 Steps to Build an AQI Prediction Model**

### **1️⃣ Data Collection**  
✅ Use public datasets like:  
   - **EPA Air Quality Data**  
   - **OpenAQ**  
   - **World Air Quality Index**  

✅ Collect data on pollutants and meteorological factors:  
   - **Pollutants:** PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, O₃  
   - **Weather Factors:** Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, Pressure  

---

### **2️⃣ Data Preprocessing**  
🔹 **Handle missing values**  
🔹 **Convert categorical data** (if any) into numerical form  
🔹 **Normalize or standardize numerical values**  
🔹 **Remove outliers**  

---

### **3️⃣ Feature Engineering**  
📊 **Select relevant features:** Pollutant concentrations, weather data  
📊 **Create lag features** (for time-series modeling)  
📊 **Use feature selection methods** like correlation analysis  

---

### **4️⃣ Model Selection**  
🛠 **Regression Models (Predict AQI values):**  
   - **Linear Regression**  
   - **Random Forest Regressor**  
   - **XGBoost**  

🛠 **Classification Models (Categorize AQI levels):**  
   - **Decision Tree Classifier**  
   - **Random Forest Classifier**  
   - **Neural Networks**  

---

### **5️⃣ Model Training & Evaluation**  
✅ **Split dataset:** 80% training, 20% testing  
✅ **Train model on the training set**  
✅ **Evaluate performance using metrics:**  
   - **Regression:** MAE, RMSE, R² Score  
   - **Classification:** Accuracy, F1-Score, Precision, Recall  

---

### **6️⃣ Deployment**  
🚀 **Deploy using APIs:** Flask/FastAPI  
📊 **Visualization:** Streamlit/Dash  
☁️ **Cloud Deployment:** AWS, GCP, or Azure

# **🌟 Uses of an Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction Model 🌍💨**  

### **1️⃣ Public Health & Awareness 👩‍⚕️**  
- **Early Warnings for Pollution Spikes**: Helps governments and agencies alert the public about upcoming poor air quality.  
- **Preventive Measures**: People with respiratory diseases (asthma, bronchitis, etc.) can take precautions.

## **🌍 How Does the AQI Prediction Model Work? (Nowcasting vs Forecasting) 🔍**  

### **1️⃣ Real-Time AQI Prediction (Nowcasting)**
👉 **How it works?**  
   - Uses **real-time sensor data** from weather stations, IoT devices, or satellites.  
   - Applies a trained **ML model** to analyze the latest pollution levels and weather conditions.  
   - Predicts **current AQI** based on pollutant concentrations (PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, O₃, CO).  

✅ **Use Cases:**  
   - Shows **real-time AQI** for apps (e.g., Google Weather, AirVisual).  
   - Helps people take **immediate precautions** (e.g., mask usage, staying indoors).  
   - Can be used in **smart home air purifiers** to adjust settings dynamically.  

---

### **2️⃣ Future AQI Prediction (Forecasting)**
👉 **How it works?**  
   - Uses **historical AQI data**, meteorological data (temperature, wind, humidity), and seasonal trends.  
   - Trains a **time-series forecasting model** such as:  
     - **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Neural Networks** 📊  
     - **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)** 📈  
     - **XGBoost/Random Forest Regressors** 🌲  
   - Predicts **AQI for the next few hours, days, or weeks**.  

✅ **Use Cases:**  
   - Helps **governments and municipalities** plan pollution control strategies.  
   - Supports **industries** in adjusting emissions to reduce pollution.  
   - Alerts **individuals** to high-pollution days so they can plan outdoor activities accordingly.
